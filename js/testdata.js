Granite countertops, leather sofas, sometimes skis, climbing gear or bikes we never use.

Also, PRG or the Circuit?","I will come to a time in my backwards trip when November eleventh, accidentally my birthday, was a sacred day called Armistice Day. When I was a boy, and when Dwayne Hoover was a boy, all the people of all the nations which had fought in the First World War were silent during the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of Armistice Day, which was the eleventh day of the eleventh month.\n\nIt was during that minute in nineteen hundred and eighteen, that millions upon millions of human beings stopped butchering one another. I have talked to old men who were on battlefields during that minute. They have told me in one way or another that the sudden silence was the Voice of God. So we still have among us some men who can remember when God spoke clearly to mankind.\n\nArmistice Day has become Veterans' Day. Armistice Day was sacred. Veterans' Day is not.\n\nSo I will throw Veterans' Day over my shoulder. Armistice Day I will keep. I don't want to throw away any sacred things.\n\n-Kurt Vonnegut, Breakfast of Champions","Dear person who dismantled my bike (which was locked with two different locks) in order to steal my front fork and handlebars: There is a special place in hell reserved for bike thieves and people who talk at the movies.

Be as I am — a reluctant enthusiast... a part-time crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save the other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventure. It is not enough to fight for the land; it is even more important to enjoy it. While you can. While it’s still here. So get out there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, climb the mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breathe deep of that yet sweet and lucid air, sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness, the lovely, mysterious, and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this much; I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound men and women with their hearts in a safe deposit box, and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this; You will outlive the bastards.”\n-Edward Abbey, from a speech to environmentalists in Missoula, Montana (speech published 24 September 1976)","TODAY WAS/IS SO GOOD","A guy came and changed the lock to our suite (suite 1003) this morning.
